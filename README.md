# Risk Factors of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Infection in Infants: A Study Using New York State Inpatient and Outpatient Databases 

### 1. Specific Aims & Hypotheses
This study aims to identify risk factors associated with the first Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection within the first two years of life among infants in New York by constructing birth cohorts from the State Inpatient Database (SID) and the State Emergency Department Database (SEDD). My study is aimed at discovering risk factors that could influence the timing and occurrence of the first RSV infection.
### 2. Background & Rationale
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a widespread seasonal respiratory viral pathogen that is a leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality worldwide. This study will use a comprehensive statewide inpatient and emergency department database (HCUP) to examine the occurrence of RSV infections in different populations in New York to understand the risk factors of RSV. Our goal is to uncover patterns of RSV infection that reflect real-world health care disparities, particularly those faced by marginalized populations, and to provide insights into targeted RSV prevention and health equity.
### 3. Methods
##### a. Study Design
This is a retrospective cohort study. We will construct a birth cohort of infants born in New York and follow them for up to two years to evaluate the time until their first documented RSV episode in either inpatient (SID) or outpatient (SEDD) settings.
##### b. Study Population
The population will consist of infants born in New York from 2014 to 2020. Individual-level data such as birth weight, race/ethnicity, and the presence of chronic conditions (ICD-10) will be extracted from the SID and SEDD databases. Additionally, socioeconomic factors like income quantiles will be incorporated based on the infants’ residential ZIP codes.
##### c. Sample Size/Power Calculations
Because this study is observational and exploratory, with the focus on identifying associations rather than testing predefined hypotheses, traditional sample size and power calculations do not apply. Instead, the study will leverage the entire available data set to maximize statistical power by analyzing all eligible cases. This approach allows for a comprehensive assessment of potential risk factors for RSV infection in different subgroups, supporting robust, data-driven insights into health disparities and infection patterns.
##### d. Data Analysis Plan and Software to be Used
Data cleaning, manipulation, statistical analysis and visualization will be conducted using R Studio (Version 2023.12.1+402).
### 4. Competencies
##### a. Discuss the means by which structural bias, social inequities, and racism undermine health and create challenges to achieving health equity at organizational, community, and societal levels:
An essential part of my thesis will be interpreting findings to inform policy and practice, particularly in developing prevention strategies for RSV. My study results are intended to provide insights for policymakers and healthcare providers. In addition, I will examine how variations in income levels across different locations of New York impact the risk and timing of the first RSV infection. This will involve analyzing ZIP code-level socioeconomic data to understand disparities in RSV burden and identifying areas where targeted interventions could address health inequities.
##### b. Analyze quantitative and qualitative data using biostatistics, informatics, computer-based programming and software, as appropriate:
In my research, I’ll leverage biostatistics and informatics research methods in R to analyze complex datasets on RSV infections in infants. By applying statistical methods to demographic and socioeconomic data.
##### c. Interpret and apply quantitative data to identify factors that influence infectious disease transmission and project disease risk in the future:
I will use quantitative data to identify factors that influence RSV transmission in infants and predict future risk. Analysis of demographic and socio-economic data will help identify at-risk groups and guide targeted prevention efforts.
